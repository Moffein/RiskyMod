## True Oneshot Protection

- No longer counts shields or barrier.
- Now triggers if you go from >90% HP to 0% in under 0.5s
	- Grants 0.5s grace period when triggered.
- Recharges when >90% HP and out of danger (no damage taken for 7s)
- Transcendence ignores this and uses Vanilla OSP rules.
	- This is due to technical issues I ran into when attempting to implement it.
		
## Shield Gating

- Shields now gate against HP damage like in RoR1.
	- Champion enemies (bosses) ignore shieldgating.
- Disabled while carrying Transcendence.

## General
	
- Freeze
	- Counts as a debuff.
	- Can execute bosses at 10% HP.

- Barrier
	- **(RiskyTweaks)** Decays faster at high amounts and slower at low amounts.
	
- Shock
	- **(RiskyTweaks)** No longer gets interrupted by damage.
