## False Son

Fixing up his weird proc coefficients and nerfing his survivability a bit.

## Passive

- Reduced health from 180 (+54) -> 160 (+48)
- Increased Growth cost by 60%

	*Bison Steak, Infusion, and Titanic Knurl buffs make it a lot easier to stack Growth compared to Vanilla. With the new HP + Growth values, it now takes 2 Steaks to get +2 Spikes like in Vanilla, but overall scales slightly faster compared to Vanilla still.*
	
- Armor per held spike increased from +2.5 -> +5

	*Compensating for the reduced max health, while also making the survivability bonus of holding spikes more relevant.*

- Health Regen bonus per missing spike reduced from +2.5 flat -> +0.5 level-scaled

	*Being able to easily get +10hp/s of regen earlygame trivializes the first few stages. New regen value makes the earlygame regen just a bit higher than other melee survivors, and at level 20 it breaks even with the original flat amount.*

## Primaries

- Club of the Foraken
	- **(RiskyTweaks)** Airslam proc coefficient reduced from 1.5 -> 1.0
	- **(RiskyTweaks)** Removed hidden non-scaling cooldown on the slam.

## Specials

- Laser of the Father
	- **(RiskyTweaks)** Proc coefficient increased from 0.5 -> 1.0
	- Reduced charge duration from 2s -> 1.5s
	- Increased fire rate to reduce total state time from 4s -> 3s
	- Removed falloff.
	
	*This has fallen by the wayside ever since Laser Burst got buffed.*
