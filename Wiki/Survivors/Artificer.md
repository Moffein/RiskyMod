## Artificer

Most significant gameplay changes come from her Snapfreeze being able to defend against attacks. Additionally, it can be used to execute bosses and can be targeted at flying enemies (for less effectiveness than using it on the ground).

Alongside that are some minor number buffs to help her keep up with the newer high damage combo character archtype like Bandit/CHEF, though her output is still lower than those 2 even with these changes.

## General

- Freeze can execute bosses at 10% health.

## Primaries

- Firebolt
	- Damage split from 280% -> 4x70%
		- Each DoT tick has a 2.5m blast radius, and sticks to each enemy hit.
		- Technically allows for double-dipping on damage in scenarios where enemies are grouped up enough to get caught in the AoE, but this is more of a rare bonus than a main feature to play around.
	- Hitcount scales with attack speed.
	- CD no longer scales with attack speed.
	
- Plasmabolt
	- Damage increased from 280% -> 4x85%, and now slows on hit.
		- This is a lingering AoE that repeatedly zaps enemies.
		- Slightly pulls in lightweight enemies.
	- Radius increased from 6m -> 7.5m
	- Hitcount scales with attack speed.
	- CD no longer scales with attack speed.
	
## Secondaries
	
- Cast Nano-Spear
	- Increased damage from 1200% -> 1600% to make it more competitive with Nano-Bomb.
	
## Utilities

- Snapfreeze
	- Blocks ranged attacks.
		- This includes LoS attacks like Vagrant Novas.
		
	- Can be aimed at airborne enemies.
