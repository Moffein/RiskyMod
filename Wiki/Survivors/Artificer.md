## Artificer

Most significant gameplay changes come from her Snapfreeze being able to defend against attacks. Additionally, it can be used to execute bosses and can be targeted at flying enemies (for less effectiveness than using it on the ground).

Alongside that are some minor number buffs to help her keep up with the newer high damage combo character archtype like Bandit/CHEF, though her output is still lower than those 2 even with these changes.
