## Acrid

This mod used to have a gameplay rework, but that's been condensed into a selectable alt passive.

## General

- **(RiskyTweaks)** Regenerative now counts as healing, and is unaffected by difficulty regen modifiers.
	- Still affected by Eclipse healing modifier.

## Passives

- **(RiskyTweaks)** Poisonous
	- Removed hidden damage cap.
	
- Blight
	- Duration refreshes on new stack.
	- Now gives +5% damage vulnerability per stack.
	- DoT damage no longer scales with stack.
	- Duration increased from 5s -> 10s.
	
	*Shifts this towards being based aroud amplifying Acrid's direct damage. Increased duration means that earlygame, a single Epidemic can kill a Lemurian from full health.*
	
- Contagion **(New)**
	- Reduces base damage by 20%.
	- Every skill applies a different DoT effect.
		- Primary: Poison on 3rd hit.
		- Secondary: Blight
		- Utility: Blight
		- Special: Infects for 6x100% damage, can trigger item effects.
			- 0.5 proc coefficient
	
	*Gameplay rework is now a selectable alt passive to improve cross-mod compatibility.*
	
## Primaries

- **(RiskyTweaks)** Vicious Wounds
	- Increased hitbox size.
	
## Utilities

- Caustic Leap
	- Increased acid puddle proc coefficient from 0.1 -> 0.7
	- Knocks enemies downwards.
	
- Frenzied Leap
	- Reduced cooldown from 10s -> 6s
	- Reduced cooldown reduction from 2s -> 1s
	- Knocks enemies downwards.
	
	*Lower cooldown should make this less of a liability to take since it's on-par with Caustic Leap now. Cooldown reduction lowered to compensate, though the real choice between the 2 is being able to stack debuffs versus being able to spam.*
