## Artificer

Pretty radical gameplay changes, aimed at giving her built-in mobility to synergize with her Hover as well as making her Freeze able to execute bosses. If you didn't like playing her before, it's worth giving her a shot.

## General

- Freeze can execute bosses at 15% health.

## Primaries

- Fire Bolt
	- Damage increased from 230% -> 300%
	
- Plasma Bolt
	- Damage increased from 230% -> 360%
	
## Secondaries
	
- Charged Nano-Bomb
	- Removed gravity, making it work like it used to in Early Access.
	
- Cast Nano-Spear
	- Increased damage from 1200% -> 1600% to make it more competitive with Nano-Bomb.
	
## Utilities

- Snapfreeze
	- Gives backwards knockback when used while airborne.
		- Does not apply when Hovering.
	- Can be aimed at airborne enemies.
		- Creates a small ice explosion on the aimpoint.
	
- Ion Surge
	- Moved to Utility slot.
	- Cooldown increased from 8s -> 12s to match Snapfreeze.
	- Now Shocks instead of Stunning.
	- **(RiskyTweaks)** No longer scales with movement speed.
	
## Specials
