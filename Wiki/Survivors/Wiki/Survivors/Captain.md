## Captain

Beacons now refresh on a cooldown.

## General

- Shock is no longer interrupted by damage.

## Passive

- Defensive Microbots
	- No longer deletes stationary projectiles. (ex. Gas Clouds, Fire Pools)
	- No longer scales off of attack speed.
	- Scales off of drone count.
	
## Primaries

- Vulcan Shotugn
	- Damage reduced from 8x120% -> 7x110%
	- Attack Speed increases pellet count, instead of reducing pump duration.
		- Can be toggled in-game with Risk of Options.
	- Fully charging removes falloff.
	
	*Damage was a bit too high, outdamaging a lot of more mechanically complex survivors by simply mashing the fire button.*
	
## Secondaries

- Power Taser
	- Shock chains to nearby targets on the initial hit.
	- Slows unshockable enemies.
	
## Utilities

- Diablo Strike
	- Increased proc coefficient from 1.0 -> 3.0
	- Bandoliers reduce cooldowns by 20s, instead of a full reduction.
	
	*Hacky change due to skill restock beacons being a thing.*
	
## Specials
