There's a lot of minor changes, so I'll just list the most noticeable ones that will actually affect your item choices.

## General
- Proc Chaining nerfed.
	- Only Ukuleles and a few other items can trigger other items.
	- Most items don't get increased range with stacks to prevent lategame instant map wiping.
- **(AssistManager)** Most on-kills can trigger on assists.
- Some Uncommon/Legendary damage items are less effective when stacked.

- Berzerker's Pauldron

	- Now has a chance to proc when taking damage, scaled to HP lost.
	- Squids distract non-Champion enemies on-hit. (non-"Boss" enemies)

- Wake of Vultures
	- Gives bonus damage against Elites

		- Installing EliteReworks will prevent it from messing with your HP when killing Overloading enemies as well, due to the Overloading rework from that mod.

	- Constructs inherit the Elite type of the enemy that was killed.
	- Constructs distract non-Champion enemies on-hit. (non-"Boss" enemies)
