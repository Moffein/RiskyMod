- **(RiskyTweaks)** Small holdouts charge at full speed as long as 1 player is in the radius. (Moon, Void)
- Teleporter expands when the boss is killed.
	- Disabled in Eclipse or when Focused Convergence is active.

*Teleporter expansion keeps the initial teleporter radius so that players are encouraged to group up and fight the boss, then let players do their own thing once the boss is dead instead of forcing them to sit around doing nothing.*
